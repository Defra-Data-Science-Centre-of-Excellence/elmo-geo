"""Parcel level habitat creation and management classifications.

Habitat creation ELM actions require specifying which habitats would most suitable be created
on a parcel. This is done by combining multiple data sources:
- Soilscapes linked to which habitats can be created on each soil type
- Proximity to priority habitats
- Habitat map habitat type

Joining these three datasets together.
